This framework can inform assessments of supply-chain robustness and exposure to foreign dependencies.\n\n\n\nMy work on energy substitution and capital adjustment characterizes how economies respond over time to energy price shocks, carbon pricing, and technology constraints.

The approach is suited to identifying early-stage vulnerabilities that may not be apparent in reduced-form or sector-level analyses.\n\n\n\nAcross projects, I focus on how policy instruments interact with private investment incentives.

My work focuses on identifying when trade restrictions, energy disruptions, and industrial policy interventions induce adaptive reallocation, and when they instead generate persistent vulnerabilities and systemic risk.\nUsing dynamic AGE models, I study how investment incentives, substitution elasticities, and network structure shape aggregate resilience. My research is motivated by questions central to economic security, including supply-chain robustness, energy dependence, and exposure to geopolitical shocks.\nMy work is intended to support forward-looking risk assessment in environments characterized by strategic interaction, uncertainty, and incomplete information.\nResearch interests:\nMacroeconomics · Production Networks · Energy Policy · Industrial Policy · Economic Security\nLinks\n- Curriculum Vitae (PDF) - GitHub - Email: t.taylormcgreal@gmail.com"

    "text": "Policy frictions are rarely isolated. In tightly coupled economies, small distortions can propagate through production networks, magnify uncertainty, and alter the strategic calculus of states and firms. My interest is in identifying which nodes and linkages act as accelerants, and where targeted intervention can dampen systemic risk without imposing persistent misallocation."

I characterize when constraints induce adaptive reorganization versus persistent fragility, with implications for supply-chain security, energy dependence, and exposure to geopolitical shocks.\nThe framework is designed to identify leverage points and bottlenecks that are not visible in partial-equilibrium or sector-isolated analyses.\n\n\n\nNeural Networks in Strategic Environments\nI developed a convolutional neural network to study the limits of pure function approximation in high-dimensional strategic settings. Using chess as a controlled environment, the model maps raw board states to position evaluations without search, rollout, or lookahead.\nThe project examines when pattern recognition succeeds in adversarial environments and when it fails due to strategic nonlocality, path dependence, and regime shifts. Results highlight systematic failure modes of static predictors when incentives, constraints, or opponent responses change—providing insight into the limits of reduced-form prediction in strategic economic and policy contexts."
