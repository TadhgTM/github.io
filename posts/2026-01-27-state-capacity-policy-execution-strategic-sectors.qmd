title: "State Capacity and Policy Execution in Strategic Sectors"

description: "Strategic policy outcomes are constrained less by targets and more by administrative execution capacity."

Ambitious strategy fails when execution institutions are thin. In strategic sectors, policy success depends on whether the state can evaluate projects, enforce milestones, and update programs as conditions change.

Execution capacity has three practical components:
- Technical procurement and evaluation capability.
- Coordinated authority across ministries and levels of government.
- Feedback systems that terminate weak projects and scale strong ones.

State capacity is not an abstract governance metric. It is the binding constraint on whether strategic policy produces capability or just announcements.
