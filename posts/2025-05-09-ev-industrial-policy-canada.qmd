description: "What a Canadian EV strategy would look like if it prioritized capability, not just assembly."

Canada assembles vehicles but captures too little of the IP and supply‑chain value. A serious EV strategy would aim at capability: batteries, power electronics, software, and testing standards—plus the supply chain for critical minerals.

A realistic policy mix:
- Time‑limited protective space for domestic entrants.
- R&D funding tied to measurable milestones.
- National charging infrastructure as a demand catalyst.
- Federal‑provincial coordination to prevent fragmented incentives.

The goal isn’t autarky. It’s a domestic core strong enough to compete and retain spillovers.
