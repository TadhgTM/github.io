Canada has produced world‑class ideas and institutions, yet often behaves like a polished transit hub rather than a destination. Capital, talent, and IP pass through; fewer companies scale at home. That gap matters when supply chains, climate policy, and security shocks demand domestic capacity.

The fix isn’t nostalgia. It’s a strategy: scale R&D into homegrown firms, align finance with industrial outcomes, and lower internal frictions so the national market actually functions like one. Pair that with disciplined resource development and clear rules around strategic ownership.

The point is not to abandon values but to operationalize them. Canada’s advantage is still real; it just needs a plan that keeps value creation inside the country.
