China’s EV rise wasn’t just market‑led. It was a tightly sequenced industrial strategy: stimulate demand early, subsidize supply, build charging infrastructure, then tighten performance standards as the market scales.

Key elements that mattered:
- Early consumer subsidies to create a market floor.
- Production support and R&D to move firms down cost curves.
- Infrastructure build‑out to remove range anxiety.
- Policy tightening to force quality upgrades and consolidation.

The lesson for Canada isn’t to copy the scale, but to copy the sequencing and discipline—especially the transition from broad support to performance‑based support.
