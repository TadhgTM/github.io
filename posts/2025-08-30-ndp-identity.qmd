The NDP’s challenge is less about ideology and more about coherence: the party’s wins in government have been incremental, while the public expects scale. That mismatch erodes perceived effectiveness.

Digital presence compounds the problem. In a politics shaped by short‑form media, a policy‑heavy communication style loses attention to simpler, more emotionally legible narratives.

If the NDP wants to regain ground, it needs tighter message discipline and a clearer story about immediate, tangible benefits, not just long‑run justice arguments.
