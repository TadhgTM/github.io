Economic coercion rarely starts with formal sanctions. It usually appears first as coordinated frictions in trade finance, customs timing, licensing, procurement, and standards enforcement.

A usable early-warning dashboard should track:
- Sudden concentration shifts in critical import categories.
- Unexplained inspection delays in politically sensitive sectors.
- Credit tightening for firms linked to strategic supply chains.
- Administrative rule changes that are neutral in text but selective in effect.
- Pricing behaviour that diverges from fundamentals in key intermediates.

No single indicator is decisive. The signal is in cross-market correlation and sequencing. The objective is to identify a coercion pathway early enough to reallocate exposure.
