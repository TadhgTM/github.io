Canada’s resource base positions it as a pivotal supplier in a shifting energy and minerals landscape. But without export diversification and infrastructure, that advantage gets discounted in global markets.

Two constraints dominate: access to tidewater (pipelines, LNG terminals, ports) and policy coherence across provinces and the federal government. Without those, Canada stays a price taker, even with world‑class reserves.

A credible strategy pairs infrastructure build‑out with clean‑tech investment (e.g., CCS, grid upgrades) to keep exports competitive as the global energy mix shifts.
