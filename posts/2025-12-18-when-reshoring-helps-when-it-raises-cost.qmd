title: "When Reshoring Helps and When It Raises Systemic Cost"
date: 2025-12-18
description: "Reshoring improves resilience in some chains, but can reduce flexibility and raise system-wide cost in others."

Reshoring is not a universal resilience strategy. It works when foreign concentration risk is high, domestic scale economies are reachable, and substitution failures create strategic exposure.

It underperforms when:
- Domestic production remains structurally higher cost with no learning curve.
- Inputs still rely on concentrated upstream imports.
- Policy support protects incumbents without productivity gains.

The relevant question is not "home versus foreign." It is whether a supply configuration improves reliability per unit cost over the full risk cycle.
