A permanent demand decline changes oil economics at the balance‑sheet level. Firms that collateralize debt against reserves face liquidity stress as prices and expected recoverable value fall—turning “proven” barrels into stranded assets.

At the same time, petro‑states may respond strategically by consolidating supply in a smaller market, moving toward oligopoly behavior. That creates a bifurcation: highly leveraged private producers exit while state producers gain market power.

The policy risk is double‑sided: financial instability in oil‑heavy regions and increased geopolitical leverage for the lowest‑cost producers.
