Canada’s post‑2001 productivity slowdown looks different once you neutralize oil‑sector shocks without removing oil from the production network. I call this ON‑TFP: hold oil productivity and prices at 2001 levels, but keep its input linkages.

Using the Baqaee‑Farhi framework, the result is clear: aggregate TFP largely recovers once oil’s negative productivity shock is removed. The drag wasn’t a generalized innovation failure—it was network propagation from a central sector.

The implication is policy‑relevant: allocation and input‑cost spillovers can dominate national productivity trends, even when the shocked sector is small by value‑added.
