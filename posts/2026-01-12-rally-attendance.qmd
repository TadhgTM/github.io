Rallies are one of the most visible campaign tools, but the causal link to outcomes is unclear. A clean test needs timing, media coverage, and baseline partisanship controls.

The design I sketch is simple: regress vote share on rally attendance, with time‑to‑election weights, media amplification proxies, and demographic controls. A second layer tests “force projection” by seeing whether one party’s rallies reduce the opponent’s presence.

If the signal is real, rallies are more than optics; if not, they’re mostly narrative management. Either way, the method separates spectacle from effect.
