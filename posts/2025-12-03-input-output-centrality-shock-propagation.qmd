Sector size is a weak proxy for systemic risk. In production networks, shock intensity depends on centrality: how many sectors depend on an input, how substitutable it is, and how quickly firms can re-route demand.

Three centrality features are consistently useful:
- Upstream dependency density.
- Low-substitution bottleneck inputs.
- High pass-through into downstream cost structures.

This is why small sectors can generate large aggregate effects. A central node with low substitution can transmit a local disruption into economy-wide productivity and price pressure.
