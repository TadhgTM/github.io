Industrial policy often fails for operational reasons, not conceptual ones. Incentives that look coherent at launch drift once agencies, firms, and local governments optimise against different objectives.

Five repeat failure modes show up across sectors:
- Subsidies tied to volume instead of productivity learning.
- Weak performance gates that keep underperforming projects alive.
- Fragmented governance that duplicates support across jurisdictions.
- Political timing that front-loads announcements and back-loads execution.
- No clear exit rules when programs stop producing strategic value.

A better design starts with milestones that are technical, auditable, and reversible. If the state cannot scale discipline with spending, industrial policy becomes transfer policy.
