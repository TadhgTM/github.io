I develop and solve static and dynamic general equilibrium models to study how policy constraints and external shocks affect investment, production, and reallocation in networked economies. My work emphasizes identifying structural conditions under which localized disruptions propagate into economy-wide vulnerabilities.

These tools are applied to questions in energy and climate policy, trade and industrial policy, and economic security, with a focus on mechanisms relevant for early-warning analysis and resilience assessment.

## Working Papers

### Optimal Carbon Taxation in a Dynamic General Equilibrium Economy  
**Tadhg Taylor-McGreal**

I develop and solve a dynamic general equilibrium model with capital accumulation and heterogeneous energy technologies to characterize the welfare-maximizing carbon tax path. The model highlights how investment responses and energy substitution jointly shape optimal policy and transition dynamics.

## Work in Progress

### Policy Constraints, Production Networks, and Endogenous Investment

This project studies how trade restrictions, policy uncertainty, and input constraints propagate through production networks and alter firms’ incentives to invest in capacity, sourcing flexibility, and technology adoption. I characterize when constraints induce adaptive reorganization versus persistent fragility, with implications for supply-chain security, energy dependence, and exposure to geopolitical shocks.

The framework is designed to identify leverage points and bottlenecks that are not visible in partial-equilibrium or sector-isolated analyses.
