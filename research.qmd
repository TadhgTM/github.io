### Optimal Carbon Taxation in a Dynamic General Equilibrium Economy  
**Tadhg Taylor-McGreal**

I develop and solve a dynamic general equilibrium model with capital accumulation and heterogeneous energy technologies to characterize the welfare-maximizing carbon tax path. The model highlights how investment responses and energy substitution jointly shape optimal policy and transition dynamics.

### Policy Constraints, Production Networks, and Endogenous Investment

I study how trade restrictions and policy uncertainty propagate through production networks, altering firms’ incentives to invest in sourcing flexibility and productive capacity.
