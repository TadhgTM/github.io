# Tadhg Taylor-McGreal

**Economics student at McMaster University**  
Focused on the interplay between human-capital ecosystems, strategic resource allocation, and the security dimensions of global markets.

I study how innovation asymmetries and frictions amplify systemic risks, influence adversarial statecraft, and reshape power dynamics between nations. I aim to uncover vulnerabilities and leverage points within interconnected systems.

**Career focus:** National security, economic resilience, and strategic competition.

**Research interests:**  
Macroeconomics · General Equilibrium · Production Networks · Energy & Climate Policy · Industrial Policy · Security Economics
