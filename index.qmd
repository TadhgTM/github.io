# Tadhg Taylor-McGreal

MAEP Economics, McMaster University

I am studying how policy-imposed frictions and external shocks propagate through interconnected production systems. My work focuses on identifying when trade restrictions, energy disruptions, and industrial policy interventions induce adaptive reallocation, and when they instead generate persistent vulnerabilities and systemic risk.

Using dynamic AGE models, I study how investment incentives, substitution elasticities, and network structure shape aggregate resilience. My research is motivated by questions central to economic security, including supply-chain robustness, energy dependence, and exposure to geopolitical shocks.

My work is intended to support forward-looking risk assessment in environments characterized by strategic interaction, uncertainty, and incomplete information.
